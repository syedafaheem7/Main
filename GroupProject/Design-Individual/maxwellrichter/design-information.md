# Grocery List Creator
## Requirement 1


We have classes called **Grocery List** and **ListMaker**. A list maker can have many grocery lists. I didn’t put in a grocery store class because it didn’t seem the list was based on a specific store, but more a general grocery store. As an operation, the user can add items, delete items, and change the item quantity. The user can add an an item from the **Item** class and delete or modify the amount of items from the list class.


## Requirement 2
The project didn’t require me to implement a database so I didn’t account for this.


## Requirement 3

I made a class called **Items Type** which has a subclass called **Item** where you must go through the items type class to retrieve an item.

## Requirement 4

I added attributes to the **Item** class called actual item and the **Item Type** class called item category. From there, a list maker can search the category and eventually choose the item name.

## Requirement 5

This didn’t apply to the design.

## Requirement 6

There’s an operation for the list maker to check an item on the list.

## Requirement 7

There’s an operation for a list maker to clear all checks.


## Requirement 8

This didn’t apply to the design.

## Requirement 9

This didn’t apply to the design.

## Requirement 10

Since a list maker can have many lists, this design supports this requirement. A list maker has operations to create, rename, and delete lists.

## Requirement 11


This didn’t apply to the design.

# Notes
I filled in the diamond connecting **ListMaker** and **GroceryList** because without a list maker, the grocery list wouldn't exist.

# DESIGN DOCUMENT
## DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
### Assumptions
We're assuming this person is running the app on an android phone. We assume the person knows the usual icons that are on most applications, i.e. a plus logo means add.
### Constraints
There aren't any constraints unless we want to add items being added from specific stores.
### System Environment
The application would be used on an Android with Android software.
## Architectural Design
### Component Diagram
Since we are using Android Studio, the Android Application Package is a file formed package used by Android operating systems which wouldn't require external physical hardware. 
### Deployment Diagram
Since we are not using a component diagram, there's no components that would be applicable to the deployment diagram.
## Low Level Design
### Class Diagram

# Team Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen

## Introduction
Team Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen is making life easier for people wanting to make grocery lists on their phones. With our app, users can keep track of their grocery lists on their phone and easily add items.

## Process Description
### Create List
With this activity, users can create a new grocery list by pressing on the plus sign in the corner. From there, the user will have to enter the name of the new grocery list. The name **cannot** be the same name as an already existing grocery list. Once the user has entered the name of the new grocery list, a confirmation text will be output showing that a list has been created.
### Add Item To List
To add an item to list, a user has to be on the grocery list and click on the plus sign in the corner again. **The user must be on a specific grocery list to be able to add an item to that list.** After pressing on the plus sign, a user will have to choose which category the item would be under. From there, a list of items belonging to that category will appear and a user can select an item. If the item doesn't exist, the user has the option to add a new item to the list of items belonging to that item category.  Once the user has clicked on the item, a confirmation text will be output showing that an item has been to the list.
### Check Off Item
Once the grocery list has one item or more, the user has an option to press on a box next to that item which will then check off that item. Multiple items can be checked off. There will also be an option to check off all the items. Once an item has been checked, the user can press on a button which resembles a trash icon, which will remove all the checked items.
### Delete List
A user has the option to delete a list. Similar to items, a user can check a list  or multiple lists and press on the trash button to remove the selected lists. There will also be an option to check all the lists so all the lists can be removed at once. 
### Change Quantity
Each item added will have an ellipses to the right of it. When pressed on, a pop up will show which will give an option to change the amount of that specific item in the grocery list. There's also an option to change the item amount from units to pounds or vice versa.

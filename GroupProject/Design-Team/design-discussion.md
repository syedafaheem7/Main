# INDIVIDUAL DESIGNS
## Max Grossman
Max's design didn't need to have price under his price attribute. He also didn't have any multiplicity or description on the lines. The line connecting grocery list and item had wrong connector.

## Maxwell Richter
This design had delete list as a boolean. Change quantity was under grocery list even though it should have been under item. Furthermore, the mentor names can be improved.

## Faheem 
Faheem included a database which was stated wasn't necessary since this is strictly for design. This complicated much of the design. There were some unnecessary attributes such as date of list and item type id's. Some multiplicities were missing as well.

## Calvin Chen
Calvin used a database, which as stated above, wasn't necessary for this design. He does not have the proper relationships for the classes. Instead of using a database, he should use a "ItemType" class.

## Rachel Hirmes
Rachel put in a user class with a username and password instead of using a grand list. In addition, she had an attribute in list which was an array list which wasn't necessary. She had size which we decided to remove. Edit amount was also included in list.

## Craig Sablah
Craig had a user as opposed to a grand list. There was a size for list which wasn't necessary and a method named edit amount which was in list as opposed to item. Craig also said items had an item type while it should be item is an item type through a hierarchy.

The main commonalities between the team design and the individual designs was that all design consisted of a list class and an items class. The main difference was that some members included a database while the team design didn't include a database. Furthermore, some individual designs include the quantity as a list attribute while in the team design, quantity was included as an item attribute. 

# SUMMARY
The main lesson learned while discussing the design was that while one design may be different than another, it's important to discuss the reasonings of ones design and find a compromise which will make sense for all. For example, Max Grossman and Maxwell Richter disagreed on many topics but kept the debates respectful and realized that while both may be correct, the final product being the best it can be is what's most important. The team wanted the design to look as clean as possible with as little clutter and unnecessary attributes as possible.
